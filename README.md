  EadsGraphic x GatsbyJS
</h1>

This project is aimed at exploring the new GatsbyJS framework for developing static sites using the latest version of ReactJS. We will be moving our site away from a custom WordPress build and all the performance issues that come with it in favor of the new blazing fast GatsbyJS codebase.

## Getting Started

1. **Install the Gatsby CLI.**

   The Gatsby CLI helps you create new sites using Gatsby starters, please make sure you also have yarn package manager installed on your computer.

   ```sh
   # install the Gatsby CLI
   yarn add gatsby-cli
   ```

2. **Run gatsby develop**

   Use the Gatsby CLI to start developing on our project.

   ```sh
   cd eads-graphic-gatsbyjs/
   gatsby develop
   ```

3. **Build for deployment**

   Navigate into your new site’s directory and start it up.

   ```sh
   gatsby build
   ```
